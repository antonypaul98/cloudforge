# CloudForge checkpoint state

Starting main: `1c85712ede05caca6d825cbbd0e5edf37e3316d6`.
Provider-neutral foundation was integrated through PR #1. The historical
`build/provider-neutral-core` branch is superseded and must not be remerged.

Current integration branch: `build/application-inspection`.
Inspection reads supplied text without application execution or infrastructure
access. It preserves provider-neutral profiles and the existing mandatory approval
boundary. Declared dependency parsing avoids comments/scripts as false evidence,
retains exact source paths, rejects conflicting aliases and reports malformed
manifests. Unsupported runtimes remain explicitly unknown; inspection is limited
to root Python/Node manifests and recognized PostgreSQL/Redis dependency names.

Full local validation: 20 tests passed. Exact-head CI and safe PR merge are
required for integration. Subsequent deployment, observation, bounded simulation
and recovery gates are not claimed by this checkpoint. No infrastructure deployed.
